Welcome to Shoutbox Ticket's documentation!
===================================

**Shoutbox Tickets** is a Discord bot made for Danntheman and Shoutbox that provides 
a ticket system for support and giveaway claims.
It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API, that will be made open source so that plugins
can be made and added to the bot after being reviewed.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information on how to use the bot as a general user.
Also check out the :doc:`staff` section to learn how to use the bot as a staff member
